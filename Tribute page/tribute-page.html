                    <h3>Who was Raden Adjeng Kartini?</h3>
                    <p>Raden Adjeng Kartini was a Javanese noblewoman best known as a pioneer in the area of women's rights for native Indonesians.</p>
                    <h3>Here is a timeline of Raden Adjeng Kartinis's life:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1879</strong> - Born in a noble family in Jepara, Central Java.</li>
                        <li><strong>1885</strong> - Attend Europesche Lagere School (ELS) or equivalent to Elementary School.</li>
                        <li><strong>1892</strong> - Graduated from ELS. Kartini wanted to continue her education at HBS Semarang but was opposed by her father. She was forced to become a true noble princess by following the prevailing customs and she spent a lot of time at her house or during the pingitan period.</li>
                        <li><strong>1899</strong> - Kartini read a lot of newspapers or European cultural magazines. This became her daily activity during the pingitan period. Kartini also often sends letters to her friends in the Netherlands about her situation.</li>
                        <li><strong>1902</strong> - Kartini received an offer to continue her education by Dutch MP, Van Kol, but she canceled the offer for political reasons. That is the reason why Kartini again chose to sacrifice personal selflessness for the sake of family peace.</li>
                        <li><strong>1903</strong> - Kartini married Raden Adipati Djodjo Adiningrat with several requirements. In this year too Kartini built a school for Javanese women. she also gave birth to a son, but she died shortly afterwards.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <article>Kartini is the first modern Indonesian thinker, without her, the compilation of modern Indonesian history would not be possible. Indeed, Kartini aspired to change the conditions of life that she deemed unjust and oppressive, hidden behind traditional customs and Javanese political feudalism.</article>
                    <article>One of Kartini's acts of heroism was fighting against underage marriage (in the late 1800s, it was common for girls as young as 13 or 14 to be forcibly married), advocating for education for Javanese society, and expressing ideas for the progress of Javanese society to her correspondents in Western countries. The differential treatment between herself and her male siblings, as well as her awareness of the societal conditions around her, motivated Kartini to rise and demand women's emancipation. Later, she realized that women's education should be the foundation or strong pillar for elevating the dignity of the nation, especially for women themselves.</article>
                    <article>Kartini passed away happily, as previously conveyed to Mrs Abendanon: <i>"Even though I may not have reached the end of the road, even if I were to falter midway, I will die with content. The path is already open, and I have contributed to paving the way towards the freedom and independence of indigenous women"</i></article>
